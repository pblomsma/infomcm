"1","Who doesn t love Harry Potter?! Arrived as advertised and on time ",1
"2","One of those movies that I have watched too many times but I don t care  Still great 10/10 would recommend",1
"3","We purchased this to begin watching this much loved series of movies  We had not purchased and streamed a movie with our Amazon Prime on our TV and this was a great first experience  Low price point and was delivered immediately - which helps for anxious kiddos waiting to watch!",1
"4","This did not take long at all to be delivered upon ordering it which was a plus considering I had just finished the book and wanted to see how the movie compared  This movie is great and the actors they picked played their characters very nicely! Everybody should watch Harry Potter and read the books at least once  You will not be disappointed ",1
"5","What is there to say? Great movie no problems with the DVD or service ",1
"6","Really astonishingly-well done - even going back after all these years to watch it again  To see all of the actors as they were when it all started  To see how much attention and effort was put into something which could easily - at the time - have been phoned in: it still would have sold  But what made it what it became - was the care and attention that was given - all the way back in the first one ",1
"7","My daughter who is 6 just became interested in Harry Potter  I was very please that I could find these to rent on Amazon Prime  She loved it  So much in fact that she watched it three times in our 24 hour rental period  We will be renting the next one this weekend  I was never a fan of these movies  They just never really interested me  Boy was I mistaken  Haha  I don t know who is more excited to watch the next one  Me or her ",1
"8","I love this movie and so happy for this product! When HP and the SS first came out on DVD I spent way too much money on the cardboard fold-out case with bonus discs and plastic inserts that came unglued and made the discs pop out  When my children finally definitively destroyed both the case and the disc it was time for a replacement  How happy it made me to find this very inexpensive simplified presentation of this movie  It s a plastic case when you open it there is one simple disc that contains the movie  That s it! That s all I need! I may have to replace my Chamber of Secrets DVD as well ",1
"9","Great fun with the family  A long sit but nice to see ",1
"10","Best movie series ever  True to the books  Very well crafted  Actors are perfectly cast  I ve watched the whole series many many times  I appreciate excellent writing and well-crafted stories 

I always like books better than movies  I like the Harry Potter books so much (all-time favorite) that I was afraid even try the movies because how could they possibly do justice to the books? Well the movies were excellent and did fine justice to the books 

The Sorcerer s Stone the first book and first movie are my absolute favorites ",1
"11","Unfortunately I was not able to view this movie-I kept getting a problem with video-try again later or pick a different movie message  Very disappointing since I had actually paid $2 99 to rent for 24 hours    ",0
"12","I thought that if I bought the Blu-Ray version that it would be better than the regular DVD and since my old DVD disappeared I ordered this  Anyway I was very wrong  I noticed several scenes that were missing or truncated even from the short bit of the movie that I watched on TV a few days ago  They are in the extras but I expected a bit more  Some scenes also looked a bit grainy on my HDTV  I am disappointed ",0
"13","I m only giving this one star as I bought this specifically because it was shown to be the blu-ray/dvd/digital copy edition and what I got in the package was just the blu-ray edition  I wanted the version with the dvd because I wanted to surprise my kids with it for our road trip in a few days  I could have gotten this blu-ray for half the price at Target or Best Buy but I m going to keep it because we still need it for our blu-ray collection and I don t feel like going through the hassle of sending it back while I m trying to get ready for our vacation  I m just very upset that I didn t get what was advertised ",0
"14","The sound quality was terrible  I put my tv up to 40 and still could barely hear it  I had to rent it from Verizon ",0
"15","Terrible clarity  Had to stop film and go to HD in order to view thus spending 2 99   3 99  Not happy ",0
"16","About halfway through movie the DVD froze  Had to return it to Amazon  There seem to be many others who experienced the same thing ",0
"17","It only played half way through",0
"18","Stops halfway through movie  Tried on 3 different DVD players and also Xbox  Very disappointed as this was a gift for my son ",0
"19","I do not recommend this version for a computer    In my experience half way throught the movie it cut off  It stopped  When I tried to restart it I had to install interactual 2 0 being a huge Harry Potter fan I didn t care  I installed it  Then it said it was outdated and I had to upgrade the program  There was no way to upgrade it because the program no longer existed    I was very upset and very disappointed  I got to the mountian troll and could not finish the movie    I am giving amazon one more chance with a seperate order  However that does not take away from the fact that I could not watch this ",0
"20","A regretful purchase  I expected more I expected SOMETHING extra when I bought this in addition to the original> Now I feel like an idiot for falling for this sad trick  BE WARNED- NOTHING makes this worth purchasing if you already have the original  Picture quality was piss poor for some reason also  I love you Amazon but this was cheap ",0
